# esbuild-scripts

esbuild-flavoured `react-scripts`.

## Under construction

For the time being while working towards a suitable `v0.0.1` baseline, a fully-working draft of this entire project, including the four commands *and* react/react-native-web project templates, can be found at:

- [`ts-esbuild-react`](https://github.com/nathanjhood/ts-esbuild-react) - A react app template using esbuild and Typescript, with working version of all four scripts
- [`ts-esbuild-react-native-web`](https://github.com/nathanjhood/ts-esbuild-react-native-web) - A react app template uing esbuild and Typescript *and* React Native Web, with working version of all four scripts
- [`nathanjhood.github.io`](https://github.com/nathanjhood/nathanjhood.github.io) - my under-construction GitHub page, which is the intended final consumer of `esbuild-scripts`, and was created from the `ts-esbuild-react-native-web` template; it shall mostly resemble the template but serve as an eventual landing page, linking together all of my individual GitHub Pages under one root URL

*this repository has been created as a means to centralize further extended development of the concepts demonstrated in the above-mentioned projects. In time, their script contents shall be replaced with `esbuild-scripts`.
